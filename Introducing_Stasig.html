title: Introducing Stasig

<h1>STAtic SIte Generator</h1>

<p>In the early days of the Internet, all <em>htm</em> pages were hand-crafted. While the
main content changed from page to page, certain sections like <em>header</em> and <em>footer</em>
had to remain the same on all pages. So these sections were necessarily copy-pasted
in all pages. It all worked fine except when you have to make any change to the <em>header</em>
or <em>footer</em>. That would require making changes in all html pages... a major
maintenance hazard.</p>

<p>Then came server side technologies like CGI, ASP, PHP, JSP which had the ability
to include a file contents into another file. This basically solved the
problem described above. Also, html pages were now created dynamically, on the fly.
This is all good, but now a basic Web Server is not enough. Depending on your
language of choice, you will need to find a web host which supports your preferred
server side tech.</p>

<p>Finding a host isn't really an issue. But what if we could create a site without
any Server Side technology and also without the maintenance hazard of the old days.
A curious mind would ask <em>WHY???</em>. Well, because we can!</p>

<p>The idea is to store all articles in separate files, but without the site's
repeating elements like header and footer. Each article file would contain some
meta-data at the start, followed by the content. An example of the file would be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!--
title: hello world
--&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>All such articles are stored in <strong>articles</strong> folder. We also have a <strong>layout.html</strong>
file which contains the basic template of the site. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;{{title}}&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;{{content}}&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, a preprocessor program will iterate over all files in the <strong>articles</strong> folder
and combine it with <strong>layout.html</strong> to generate static html files. The generated
html files can then be uploaded to any web host(<strong>Github</strong> in my case) and the
site will be running without any server side processing.</p>

<p>Before we move forward, I would like to point out that such tools already exists:</p>

<ul>
<li>DocPad</li>
<li>Jekyll</li>
</ul>

<p>But I wanted something custom made, simple &amp; sweet; which would help me maintain
my blog. And thats what <strong>Stasig</strong> is!</p>

<p>Of course, a blog feels incomplete without <em>Comments</em> section. This is where I got
initially stuck up. Without a database, where am I going to store the comments?
Looking over the Internet, found <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. Just go to their
site, register an account, copy paste a piece of JS on your website. And you have
a full featured comment system embedded... really MAGIC! They automatically
create comment threads based on the URL of your site. The funny thing is, I had
always seen <em>Disqus</em> on many other blogs, most notably, jQuery. But it never
really hit me that it is a comment handling service. Of course, the downside is,
the comments are on <em>their</em> system and not yours. But you get free spam-blocking
and oAuth logins, so its fair enough.</p>

<p>If you are reading this, it means my blog is online again, created with
HTML/CSS &amp; Javascript <em>only</em>. The source code of Stasig has been hosted on
<a href="https://github.com/niloy/stasig">Github</a>. The raw files of my blog have also
been hosted <a href="https://github.com/niloy/blog">here</a>. Of course, hosting your blog
files on Github gives you free version control, something that CMS like Wordpress
would never be able to match ;). Feel free to check them out and leave your comments.</p>
